	4 parts - 
	Variables
	Input
	Processing 
	Output

Design
Variables
	(String) private variable that holds that name of the file for reading value - fname
	(boolean) private variable that set whether or not to print the reading process of this class - DEBUG
	(FileReader) read the external file - file
	(BufferedReader) buffers the characters in order to enable efficient reading of text data - buff
	(StringTokenizer) break a line into small tokens - st


Input
	A default constructor with the file name for reading - 
	public FileIO(String fname) {
		this.fname = fname;
	}
	
	Instantiate the FileReader and BufferedReader class to read the inputted file
		FileReader file = new FileReader(fname);


Processing
	FileReader and BufferedReader classes read the file
		1. Read the first line and instantiate the Franchise class, parse in the size of the array of Store objects
		2. Ignore the second line (header)
		3. From the third line, parse in data from each line to a separate method that populate information in each Store object in Franchise - buildStore()


Printing
	If DEBUG == true:
		print the reading process of the FileIO class to make sure the read and populated values are the same
	else:
		don't print
