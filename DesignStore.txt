Design
Variables
	(float[]) private array containing the number of sales per day for 5 weeks
		salesbyweek[][] = new float[5][7];
			*5 weeks - 7 days per week.
	(float[]) private arrays that holds
		a) total sales for each week - totalsalesforweek[]
		b) average daily sales for each week - avgsalesforweek[]
	(float) private variables that hold
		c) total sales for all weeks - avgsalesforweek
		d) average weekly sales - averageweeklysales
	(int) private variables that hold
		e) week with the highest amount in sales - weekHigh
		f) week		...lowest amount... - weekLow


Input
	A default constructor with no parameter - 
	public Store() {
		this.salesbyweek = new float[5][7];
	}
	

	Setter method that assign values passed from another class
	public void setsaleforweekdayintersection(int week, int day, float sale) {
		this.salesbyweek[week][day] = sale;
	}


Processing
	Getter methods that return static/private variable to the caller
	public float getDaySales(int week, int day) {
		return salesbyweek[week][day];
	}

	Methods for various operations:
		a. The total sales for each week.
			sum += salesbyweek[week][0-6]
		b. The average daily sales for each week.
			avg = sum / 7;
		c. The total sales for all the weeks.
			total += alesbyweek[0-4]
		d. The average weekly sales.
			sum += salesbyweek[0-4]
			avg = sum/5;
		e. The week with the highest amount in sales.
		f. The week with the lowest amount in sales.

		g. Call a-g


Printing
	A method that prints an array of sales
	for (float[] week : this.salesbyweek) {
		for (float day : week) {
			System.out.printf("%f ", day);
		}
	}

	A method that prints all analytical data
	System.out.printf("Total sales for each week: ");
	for (float sales : weekly) {
		System.out.printf("%.2f ", sales);
	}
