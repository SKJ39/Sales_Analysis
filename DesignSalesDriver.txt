	4 parts - 
	Variables
	Input
	Processing 
	Output

Design
Variables
	(Scanner) variable that allows the user to interact with the "app"
	(FileIO) class object that reads an external file and assign values into another object - a1
	(Franchise) class object containing several instances of the Store class created by FileIO - f
	(Store) class object containing an array of the number of sales per day for 5 weeks - store
	(boolean) variables that allows the app to run indefinitely until the user enter a designated response to quit (can also be used to prompt the user to enter a different response should it cause an "invalid error") - run


Input
	The Scanner class takes the user's input to initiate or quit the app, or choose a specific analytical data to print
		static Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

	Parse in the path to the file for reading
		FileIO a1 = new FileIO("salesdata.txt");


Processing
	A method that runs indefinitely until the user enter a "quit" response
		if (response.equals("yes)" { continue; }
		else { return; }	//quit the app

	A statement that calls the Store object to compute all analytical data
		f.calc();
		(in Franchise) stores[i].analyzeresults();

Printing
	Call the print() method from the Store object based on the user's input
	store.print(int operation);
